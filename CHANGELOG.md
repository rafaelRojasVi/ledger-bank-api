- **Schema Refactoring** - Migrated 6 schemas to use SchemaHelpers

  - `Transaction` - Now uses SchemaHelpers (-30 lines)
  - `UserBankAccount` - Now uses SchemaHelpers (-60 lines)
  - `Bank` - Now uses SchemaHelpers (-40 lines)
  - `BankBranch` - Now uses SchemaHelpers (-50 lines)
  - `UserBankLogin` - Now uses SchemaHelpers (-12 lines)
  - All schemas now use `use LedgerBankApi.Core.SchemaHelpers` instead of separate `use Ecto.Schema` + imports

- **Worker Refactoring** - Migrated 2 workers to use WorkerBehavior
  - `PaymentWorker` - Now uses WorkerBehavior (-180 lines boilerplate)
  - `BankSyncWorker` - Now uses WorkerBehavior (-100 lines boilerplate)
  - Workers now implement 3 callbacks: worker_name/0, timeout/1, perform_work/2
  - Infrastructure code (logging, telemetry, retry) automatically handled
  - Telemetry events maintained: `[:ledger_bank_api, :worker, :payment | :bank_sync, :success | :failure]`

- **Cache Refactoring** - Migrated to adapter pattern
  - `Cache` module now delegates to CacheAdapter
  - ETS implementation extracted to `Cache.EtsAdapter`
  - Configuration added: `:cache_adapter` setting
  - Zero breaking changes to cache API
  - Application initialization updated to use adapter.init()

### Fixed
- Fixed conflicting `timeout/1` callback between Oban.Worker and WorkerBehavior
- Fixed worker name consistency for telemetry events (PaymentWorker, BankSyncWorker)
- Fixed `extract_context_from_args/1` visibility (now properly public callback)

### Performance
- Reduced codebase by ~500 lines of duplicated logic
- Added ~600 lines of reusable infrastructure
- Net change: +100 lines (8% reduction in duplication)
- Improved maintainability through single source of truth
- Faster development of new features (less boilerplate)

### Removed
- Deleted `DASHBOARD_GUIDE.md` (documentation consolidation)
- Removed duplicated validation functions from individual schemas
- Removed duplicated worker infrastructure code

### In Progress
- Planning for Redis cache adapter implementation
- Considering Queryable adoption for additional services
- Evaluating GraphQL API endpoint
